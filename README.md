## Impacts of Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement on the Seasonal Cycle of CO<sub>2</sub> Flux and ocean pCO<sub>2</sub> in European Waters


A seasonal analysis was performed on five variables, with the objective of defining the impacts of Ocean Alkalinity Enhancementmonthly on their monthly and amplitude cycle. The variables are:

- Alkalinity (mmol/m<sup>3</sup>)
- pH
- Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (mmol/m<sup>3</sup>)
- CO<sub>2</sub> flux (mol/m<sup>2</sup>/yr)
- Ocean pCO<sub>2</sub> (Âµatm)

Two reference scenarios are used: SSP1-2.6 (low warming) and SSP3-7.0 (high warming).

The model domain is the European coasts (excluding the Mediterranean and the Baltic seas).
