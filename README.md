### OAE seasonal analysis


In this repository, you will find a seasonal analysis of five main variables linked to Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE):

- Alkalinity (in umol/kg)
- CO2 Flux (in kg/m-2/s-1)
- DIC (in umol/kg)
- FCO2 (in uatm)
- pH 

Monthly and seasonal trends are plotted for a baseline and an OAE scenario, both based on SSP1-2.6. 

The analysis is limited to the European coasts (excluding the Mediterranean and the Baltic seas), where OAE simulation is performed.
